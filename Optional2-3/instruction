Object oriented programming using Java
Lesson 4. More Data types and operators

One-dimensional Array
The general form to declare a one-dimensional array:
  type array-name[] = new type[size];
An individual element within an array is accessed by use of an index. An index describes the position of an element within an array. In Java, all arrays have zero as the index of their first element.
Arrays can be initialized when they are created. The general form for initializing a one dimensional array is:
  type array-name[] = {val1, val2, ..., valN};
An example of array initialization if provided in
    MinMax.java

Array boundaries are strictly enforced in Java. It is a run-time error to overrun or underrun the end of an array. You can confirm yourself with
    ArrayErr.java.


Multidimensional arrays
    TwoD.java

Irregular arrays
The use or irregular multidimensional arrays is not recommended for most applications. However, irregular arrays can be used effectively in some situations. For example, if you need a very large two dimensional array that is sparsely populated.
    Ragged.java

Initializing multidimensional arrays
type-specifier array_name[][] = {
  {val, val, val, ..., val},
  {val, val, val, ..., val},
  ...
  {val, val, val, ..., val}
};
    Squares.java

Assigning array references
As with other objects, when you assign one array reference variable to another, you are simply changing what object that variable refers to. No copy of the array will be made, the contents of one array will not be copied to the other.
    AssignARef.java

The length member
Because arrays are implemented as objects, each array has associated with a length instance variable that contains the number of elements that the array can hold.
    LengthDemo.java

The For-Each Style for Loop
When working with arrays, it is so common to encounter situations in which each element in an array must be examined, from start to finish. Java defines a second form of the for loop that streamlines this operation.
The general form of the for-each style for is shown here:
  for(type itr-var: collection)
    statement-block

    ForEach.java

There is one important point to understand about the for-each style for loop. Its iteration variable is "read-only". An assignment to the iteration variable has no effect on the underlying array.
    NoChange.java

Strings
In some other programming languages, a string is an array of characters. This is not the case with Java. In Java, strings are objects.
    StringDemo.java
    StrOps.java

Strings are immutable
The contents of a String object are immutable. That is, one created the character sequence that makes up the string cannot be altered. When you need a string that is a variation on one that already exists, simply create a new string that contains the desired changes.

Using a String to Control a switch statement
From JDK 7, a String can be used to control a switch statement.
    StringSwitch.java

Using Command-Line Arguments
Now that you know about the String class, you can understand the args parameter to main().

    Phone.java


The bitwise operators
Can be used on values of type long, int, short, char, or byte. Bitwise can not be used on boolean, float, or double, or class types.
  Operator      Result
  &             Bitwise AND
  |             Bitwise OR
  ^             Bitwise exclusive OR
  >>            Shift right
  >>>           Unsigned shift right
  <<            Shift left
  ~             One's complement (unary NOT)
    ShowBits.java


The shift operators
The general forms are:
    value << num-bits
    value >> num-bits
    value >>> num-bits
Each left shift causes all bits within the specified value to be shifted left one position and a 0 bit to be brought in on the right.
Each right shift shifts all bits to the right one position and preserves the sign bit.
If you don't want to preserve the sign bit when shifting right, you can use an unsigned right shift (>>>), which always brings in a 0 on the left.
    ShiftDemo.java

The ? operator
The ? operator is called a ternary operator, because it requires three operand. The general form is:
    Exp1? Exp2: Exp3;
