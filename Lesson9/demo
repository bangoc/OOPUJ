Object oriented programming using Java
Lesson 9. Aggregation and Composition, Using I/O

Java programs perform I/O through streams. An I/O stream is an abstraction that either produces or consumes information. A stream is linked to a physical device by the Java I/O system.
Java implements I/O streams within class hierarchies defined in the java.io package.


Byte streams and character streams
Modern versions of Java define two types of I/O streams: byte and character. Byte streams provide a convenitent means for handling input and output of bytes. Character streams are designed for handling the input and output of characters.
For the most part, the functionality of byte streams is paralleled by that of the character streams. At the lowest level, all I/O is still byte-oriented.


The Byte Stream Classes
Byte streams are defined by using two class hierarchies. At the top of these are two abstract classes: InputStream and OutputStream.

Don't be overwhelmed by the number of different classes. Once you can use one byte stream, the others are easy to master.


The Character Stream Classes
Character streams are defined by using two class hierarchies topped by these two abstract classes: Reader and Writer. Reader is used for input, and Writer is used for output.

The Predefined Streams
All Java programs automatically import the java.lang package. This package defined a class called System, it contains three predefined stream variables, called in, out, and err.
System.out refers to the standard output stream.
System.in refers to the standard input stream.
System.err refers to the standard error stream.
System.in is an object of type InputStream; System.out and System.err are objects of type PrintStream. These are byte streams, even though they are typically used to read write characters from and to the console.

Using the Byte Streams
In gerneral, the methods in InputStream and OutputStream can throw an IOException on error. The methods defined by these two abstract classes are available to all of their subclasses.

Reading Console Input
Originally, the only way to perform console input was to use a byte stream. Today, you can use byte or character streams.
Because System.in is an instance of InputStream, you automatically have access to the methods defined in

Writing Console Output
Since PrintStream is an output stream derived from OutputStream, it also implement the low-level method write(). However, you will not often use write() to perform console output, since print() and println() are substantially easier to use.


Reading and Writing Files using Byte Streams
FileInputStream and FileOutputStream can be used to read and write files. Here are some commonly used constructor:
  FileInputStream(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
  FileOutputStream(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
