Object Oriented Programming using Java
Lesson8. Polymorphism

Recap from Lesson4
Method overriding
In a class hierarchy, when a method in a subclass has the same return type and signature as a method in its superclass, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the superclass. When an overridden method is called using a reference of superclass type, it will always refer to the version of that method defined by the most derived subclass.

Polymorphysim
Method overriding forms the basis for dynamic method dispatch in Java, by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time. This is how Java implements runtime polymorphism.

Task 1. Complete the definition of class Tea in TemplateMethod.

Task 2. Complete the definition of class Duck in DuckSort to get the output as in
    DuckSort/output.png
Continue with other sorting criteria as you wish.
