Components and Containers
Conceptually, a Swing GUI consists of two key items: components and containers.
A container is a special type of component that is designed to hold other components.
In order for a component to be displayed, it must be held within a container.
Thus, all Swing GUIs will have at least one container.
Because containers are components, a container can also hold other containers.

Layout Managers

Event Listeners
A listener is an object that is notified when an event occurs. First, it must have registered with one or more sources to receive a specific type of event. Second, it must implement a method to receive and process that event.
