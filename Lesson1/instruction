Object oriented programming using Java
Lesson 1. Install the JDK and try simple examples

1. Obtaining the Java Development Kit
It is recommended that you use JDK 9 (or later).
The JDK can be downloaded from 
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
Just follow the instruction for the type of computer that you have.
The JDK supplies two primary program:
- javac is the Java compiler
- java is the Java interpreter (applicaion launcher)
The JDK runs in the command prompt environment. It is not a windowed application. It is not an integrated development environment.
2. A first simple program
class Example {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Java is cool!");
  }
}
You will follow these three steps:
1. Enter the program
2. Compile the program
3. Run the program

Step 1. Enter the program
This source can be downloaded from 
https://github.com/bangoc/OOPUJ/blob/master/Example.java
However you can enter the programs by yourself using a text editor.
For Java the name you give to a source file is very important. For this example, the name of the source file should be Example.java.
In Java, a source file is officially called a compilation unit. The Java compiler requires that a source file use the .java extension. The name of the main class should match the name of the file that holds the program. Java is case sensitive.
Step 2. Compile the program
javac Example.java
The javac compiler creates a file called Example.class that contains the bytecode version of the program.
Step 3. Run the program
To run the program you must use the Java interpreter
java Example
When the program is run, the following output is displayed:
Java is cool!
2. Experiment with simple examples
Compile and run other examples in Lesson1
